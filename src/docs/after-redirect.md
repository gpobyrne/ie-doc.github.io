# New documentation site

You have been redirected to the new Freeplane documentation site.

Download and install the latest Freeplane version from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane/files/).

Most of the MediaWiki content ended up here, segregated into

* [Docs](/) – the most relevant documentation
* [Attic (draft documents)](attic/old-mediawiki-content/Home.md) – most of the other pages of the old MediaWiki

The old mediawiki instance can be found at https://www.freeplane.org/oldwiki.
