* download freeplane_<version>+upstream-1_all.deb
* install it using
<code>dpkg -i *.deb</code>

* this will create a menu entry for Freeplane, mime type mappings etc
* you're done ;-).

* Then choose Open with Archive manager, and press OK <br><br>

2. Extract the freeplane directory

* In the download window press extract, select the location (e.g. Documents) and press Extract again.
