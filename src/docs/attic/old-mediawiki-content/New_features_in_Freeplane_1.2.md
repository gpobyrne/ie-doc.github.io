The following describes the difference between Freeplane 1.1.3 and Freeplane 1.2.x. To load the development version 1.2.x go to the [preview area](http://www.freeplane.org/preview/).''

## New user configuration file folder location
If you are already a Freeplane user, you may want to transfer your previous settings to the new preview version. After installation you can copy your configuration files to the following folders depending on the OS you use:
* under (old) Windows: %appdata%\Freeplane\1.2.x 
* Windows 7: %user%\AppData\Roaming\Freeplane\1.2.x (Only visible if Show hidden files is turned ON)
* under Mac and Linux: ~/.freeplane/1.2.x 
* Portable Freeplane: [INSTALL]/Data/Freeplane/1.2.x

You can open this directory in a file manager via the Freeplane menu under *Tools -> Open User Directory*.

## The most important new features
### Implemented
* [Node styles](../user-documentation/styles.md) replace style patterns (like in text processors)

* [Map templates](Map_templates.md) for new maps (all previous maps can be used)
* [Menus and commands](Menus_and_commands.md) have been re-ordered to improve user efficiency (both to better integrate new features and to give a more "natural access" to already existing features)
* Properties panel - [Format tab](../user-documentation/styles.md)
* Hyperlinks for menu items
* Keyboard shortcut documentation: Map and HTML table generation added for the documentation map

* You can now create "brackets" to add a graphical and text summary to some nodes, see <mm>[applet|sample brackets map](:Example-SummaryNodes.mm.md) </mm>
* Freeplane portable version (download and install file named *FreeplanePortable_X.paf.exe*)
* File -> Properties... dialog shows informations about the map (e.g. total number of nodes)
