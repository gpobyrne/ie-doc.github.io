This version is really nice to read a Freeplane mind map on your Windows Mobile device and allows you to make some basic changes to the map. 

Yet Freeplane for Windows Mobile is available in english only.

The Windows Mobile version of Freeplane can be [downloaded here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane/files/freeplane%20for%20windows%20mobile/).
