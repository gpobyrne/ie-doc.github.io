Any mind map can be used as a template for new mind maps. In this case its styles and nodes are copied to the new map.

* Use action "File->new map from template..." to select a template map.
* There are standard folders with user templates and standard templates which can be accessed from the "new map..." action, "save as..." action and "copy styles..." action.


## Default template
"File->New map" action asks no questions and uses 'standard.mm' as a template. It is first searched in the user template folder (use *Tools->Open user directory*, then open the *template* folder), then in the installation template folder.

This default template could be changed in preferences (Tools > Preferences > Environment > Standard Template File)
