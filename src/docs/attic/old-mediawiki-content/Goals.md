Our main goals for Freeplane are: 

Better Mind Map editor than FreeMind 

*Better usability, 
*More features, 
*Frequent [releases](Release_cycle.md)

through better project organization, 

*Big and effective developer [Team](Team.md). I believe that much more people were willing to contribute to this extraordinary sensible and helpful project as a mind map editor. 
*So the development speed can be increased and time between the releases can be significantly shortened. 
*People like you and me systematically contributing to the project should get more influence on the project decisions. 
*There should be clearly communicated and broadly discussion of the further development ideas, steps, goals and visions. 
*A strong project [Visions](Visions.md) and the freedom to implement new ideas

better [architecture and design](Architecture.md) 

*current FreeMind implementation is hard to extend and maintain. I have tried to collect the most critical points [here](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Freemind_refactoring_plan). Such refactoring is not easy, but I think if we want to give new developer a chance to make good contributions, we must provide clear architecture and design first.

A large, friendly community in which your voice will be heard.
